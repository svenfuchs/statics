Section type is determined by presence of directories named _posts, _articles etc or Page by default.
If a Page does not have a content by itself it displays a list of its child Page summaries.

1. be able to import a filesystem structure to a nested Hash structure (could be sent as json, serialized to couchdb, sqlite or whatever)
2. be able to export a simple static site from this data
